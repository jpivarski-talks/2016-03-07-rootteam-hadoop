\begin{frame}{Context}

\begin{block}{}
The commercial ``Big Data'' movement developed more or less independently of high energy physics, even though many of the same problems had to be solved.
\end{block}

\begin{block}{}
This talk is about the differences I have seen between the two communities, with an emphasis on technical choices, to aid in integration and interoperablity.
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Language choice}
\begin{block}{Short answer}
Commercial distributed systems are usually implemented in Java, and so distributed data processing systems like Hadoop and Spark are JVM (Java or compatible language).
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Long answer}
This is the topic I get the most questions about, so I'll break it down by project.
\end{block}
